# Object-Oriented-Java-Programming-Data-Structures-and-Beyond-Specialization
Welcome to the progress tracker for the Object Oriented Java Programming Data Structures and Beyond Specialization.  This Specialization consists of 5 courses they covers intermediate topics in software development. You’ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, and you’ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with. Below you'll find the details and progress of each course.
